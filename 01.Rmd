# Introduction to Genomics

**Chapter Objectives:**

-   Describe what makes up a gene and genome
-   Understand how genes and genomes are regulated
-   Differentiate between the different types of genome mutations
-   List the general steps required of high-throughput sequencing

## Genes, Genomes, and Genomics

DNA: the building blocks of life. ![The four nucleotides of DNA. Source:

Gene: A unit of nucleotides that when transcribed, create a functional
RNA sequence.

RNA: intermediate messenger; different types! ![RNA transcribed from

Protein: macromolecules consisting of amino acids that are translated
from an RNA sequence. ![RNA to Protein. Source:

Genome: the sum of all genes; the instructions of life. ![The Human

Genomics: The study of genomes (structure, function, sequences)

## Gene regulation

The process by which genes are controlled. When they are turned on or
off, how much to make. Often has a cascading effect.

### Transcriptional regulation

Control output of transcripts *before* transcription occurs.

### Post-transcriptional regulation

Control what happens to transcripts *after* they are made.
